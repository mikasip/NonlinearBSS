\usage{
iVAEar1_segmentation(
  data,
  locations,
  segment_sizes,
  joint_segment_inds = rep(1, length(segment_sizes)),
  latent_dim,
  n_s,
  test_inds = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix of observed data (n x p) where each row is an observation and each column is a feature.}

\item{locations}{A matrix of spatial or temporal locations corresponding to each observation in \code{data}.
Each row represents the coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude for spatial data, or time indices for temporal data).}

\item{segment_sizes}{A vector of sizes of each segment in the data, indicating the number of observations in each segment.}

\item{joint_segment_inds}{A vector of indices (default: \code{rep(1, length(segment_sizes))}) specifying which 
segments should be treated as part of the same joint process. This allows combining segments.}

\item{latent_dim}{An integer specifying the number of latent dimensions for the iVAE model.}

\item{n_s}{The number of previous observations used to form the autoregressive prior. This corresponds to the 
number of time steps or observations used for conditioning in the latent space.}

\item{test_inds}{An optional vector of indices for test data. If provided, the data at these indices will be held 
out for evaluation as a test set. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying \code{\link{iVAEar1}} function, including hyperparameters 
such as epochs, batch size, and model architecture specifications.}
}
\value{
A fitted iVAEar1 object of class \code{"iVAEar1_spatial"}, which includes:
\itemize{
  \item \code{spatial_dim}: The dimensionality of the \code{locations} data (e.g., 2 for spatial, 1 for temporal).
  \item \code{test_data}: The test data, if \code{test_inds} is provided.
  \item \code{test_aux_data}: The auxiliary data corresponding to the test set, if \code{test_inds} is provided.
  \item Other components from the \code{\link{iVAEar1}} model, such as encoder, decoder, and latent variable estimates.
}

\description{
Fits an identifiable Variational Autoencoder with an autoregressive prior (iVAEar1) to segmented data. 
This function is designed for spatial or temporal segmentation, where the data is divided into regions 
or time blocks, and auxiliary data is constructed from spatial or temporal information.
}
\details{
The function constructs auxiliary data based on the spatial or temporal structure of the observations, 
specified by \code{locations} and \code{segment_sizes}. This auxiliary data is used as an input to the 
variational autoencoder, allowing the model to account for spatial or temporal dependencies. The function 
also supports test data, which can be specified via the \code{test_inds} argument.

The autoregressive prior in the iVAE model is constructed by using \code{n_s} prior observations, allowing 
the model to capture time-dependent or location-dependent latent dynamics across the segments.

# Example usage with spatial data
data <- matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 100, ncol = 10)  # Simulated data
locations <- matrix(runif(200), nrow = 100, ncol = 2)  # Random 2D locations
segment_sizes <- rep(10, 10)  # 10 segments of size 10
latent_dim <- 3  # 3 latent dimensions
n_s <- 5  # Use 5 previous observations for the autoregressive prior

result <- iVAEar1_segmentation(
  data = data, 
  locations = locations, 
  segment_sizes = segment_sizes, 
  latent_dim = latent_dim, 
  n_s = n_s
